    Foundation Reflections
    </h1>
    <p>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
        I have a lot of past programing knowledge that I was able to leverage throughout the core program. However, I did find some challenges with using DOM and EventListener events. To resolve these issues I did a lot of research and read a lot of material online to bring up my knowledge of how these work, and what is best to use and at what time. 
        I really have to have better time management. This sprint ran over and I felt that I was falling behind. Working with Dom and EventListeners took more than a week to complete, I did reach out for help, however, I was given more material to review. 
        I have to ensure I have better sleep management. Being unable to sleep because I was so far behind, ended up in me losing a whole day. This was a serious setback and I found myself being stressed and concerned about my ability to complete the foundation. 
       
    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>Obviously not to get overly frustrated and to act on this frustration. Frustration is part of the process of learning. It is important to learn and understand one’s emotions and accept that this is part of the process. 
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>The core learning is to recognise that you will be going through an intense learning process and to understand the changes that one has to adapt to. It also makes the case that an individual is capable of learning.  </p>    
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I felt in parts it was more challenging than initially predicted. I did this program some years ago. There were 9 weeks of foundation then. The work was in smaller, perhaps more manageable chunks. This time round the work was compacted in a shorter time frame of 6 weeks and individuals have to be more familiar with more complex techniques. Perhaps I am looking at this from a different way of coding. But it was stressful.  </p>  
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>The course has the potential to be quite challenging regardless of the students abilities. Therefore, a state of mind would be an important factor in a student's development. Going through an education program of this nature, has the potential to create a lot of change in an individual, particularly with the nature of coding. These are frustration and financial considerations also. 
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>No, I don’t believe this time spent was wasted. Clearly with the full time course, more complex ways of coding are to come and it is best to be prepared for it. It is probably best for the course to set out ways and challenges to code so as to gauge the coder/students abilities. </p>
