HTML & CSS Blog Setup
Reflections
This step was quite easy and straight forward to setup the blog from the Github interface, all it took was a few google terms. 
Given the previous Sprint steps working with command line, establishing directories and pages was straight forward. 

Learn HTML & CSS
Reflections
Learning or re-learning HTML, HTML5, Basic CSS and Responsive Web Design, this was again straightforward. However, CSS margin/padding/borders was a bit of a learning, also the @media aspects of Css components was some what complicated. I had not dealt with this in the past. It took quite some time with the @media to figure out how it worked. 
I had to stay within the CSS or Cascading rules and also the logic of the script. 

DevTools Tutorial
The dev tools was a little more complicated, I had to rap my head around Ajax, and calling and declaring variables into the console of the Devtools UI on Google Chrome. Using cookies and looking at storing details on the client browser, and Error testing. I had issue with trying to test localhost on my machine, and then fork the repo and then upload the repo to my own Github. This had issue displaying the page. Also, I was not set up for access to the https://github.com/dev-academy-foundations/resources/ folder, I had to reach out to group to get access which tok some time. 

Add HTML & CSS to your Blog
Hi Team, this peice ofwork took quite some time to implement. I had to focus on building out the web page HTML and CSS peice by peice and then up load it to Github. I did eventually find a way of locking at the web page locally on my machine, however it took quite some time to see the changes that were implemented, through the localhost. Using HTMl I linked within the Header tag to the CSS file and set up the title. Then within the Body tag set about splitting up the page into sections, Header, Main and footer. This also included individual anchor, H1, h2 and other tags. Using the Dev tool, was insightful. Being able to understand why certain tag cascades were not linking to the HTML. 

Learning Concepetencies
What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
In HTML and CSS there are a number of different properties that can be called that would surrounded a particular stated area of a Web Page, i.e. Tables, Top, Bottom, Navigation, banner and main contents. Margins, Borders and padding are stated options to a particular area where these styles can be added. These typical sMargins are used to create space around elements, outside, at the border or within.

Margins
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. These elements can have a number of different styles that can be attached to them to ensure that they are separated from different areas of a Web Page. The most common properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left), or one universal setting for all (margins).
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left

These can be set either by pixels, percentages, em's, inherited by a parent Style. There are other property settings that can be set, but we will focus on these ones for the present moment.

Borders
The border property in CSS is used to style the border of an element. This property is a combination of three other properties border-width, border-style, and border-color which can be used as a shorthand notation for these three properties. It sets or returns the border-width, border-style, border-color Properties. Border styles can be set to a number of different types. These include; solid, none, hidden, dashed, dotted and double. Borders are the in effect barrier of the element.

Padding
Padding is the area within the border of the element that can be set up to distance the main text/content from the border of the element itself. CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:
padding-top, padding-righ, padding-bottom, padding-left
Padding width can be defined for the whole area or as stated above can be set for each side of the element.
It is important to note that you can add Margin and Padding to an element, when developing try to avoid duplicate efforts.

How I used these Styles
When using the Style's, I worked from the outside in. This is an approach that worked for me. For example I set up margins on the outside of the main area. To define the outside structure of the page and from there I worked inwards. Setting up padding for individual elements. This is so as to display the contents in a controlled manner.
