HTML & CSS Blog Setup
Reflections
This step was quite easy and straight forward to setup the blog from the Github interface, all it took was a few google terms. 
Given the previous Sprint steps working with command line, establishing directories and pages was straight forward. 

Learn HTML & CSS
Reflections
Learning or re-learning HTML, HTML5, Basic CSS and Responsive Web Design, this was again straightforward. However, CSS margin/padding/borders was a bit of a learning, also the @media aspects of Css components was some what complicated. I had not dealt with this in the past. It took quite some time with the @media to figure out how it worked. 
I had to stay within the CSS or Cascading rules and also the logic of the script. 

DevTools Tutorial
The dev tools was a little more complicated, I had to rap my head around Ajax, and calling and declaring variables into the console of the Devtools UI on Google Chrome. Using cookies and looking at storing details on the client browser, and Error testing. I had issue with trying to test localhost on my machine, and then fork the repo and then upload the repo to my own Github. This had issue displaying the page. Also, I was not set up for access to the https://github.com/dev-academy-foundations/resources/ folder, I had to reach out to group to get access which tok some time.
