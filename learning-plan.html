    <h1> Learning Plan</h1>
</p>

<h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
<p>
    At present my focus is to move away from my career in Banking and to get a Job or enter into a Career as a Software Developer. The reason for this recent push is to develop a skill set that will have value and provide Job Security into the future. I also enjoy problem solving and am interested in technical developments. 
</p>
<h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
<p>
    Setting aside the time and patience to sit down and do the work. Staying focused and concentrating on the work at hand, avoiding distractions. I regularly go to the gym to keep myself strong and healthy. Knowing when to take breaks and celebrating wins. Not to get into too much of a negative space if something goes wrong and avoid beating myself up over failures. Taking breaks and reflecting on the work that has been done is a good attitude I have come to overtime.  
</p>


<h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>
    Team skills such as inter communications skills and working within a team to achieve an outcome. Managing Team dynamics, knowing when to seek support for myself and when to support others. Interview and Job-seeking skills to get into the industry and through interview processes and personal brand development. 
</p>

<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>

<h3>1. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
<p>
I have left my job, so as I can give my total attention to the program. I also have to note that I have completed this course previously. However, I am aware that the curriculum can change and the material covered may have matured. It also needs to be considered that a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. If there are challenges that are overwhelming and I find that I am struggling, I feel it would be best to present this issue to a support team member or tutor and the earliest opportunity. 
</p>
<h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
<p>
Make a list of what the issues are and break them into sizable chunks. Remind myself to take a break to get some perspective. Focus on the large tasks first (big rock’s), break down the task into sizable tasks and focus on completing them. If I am very far behind then it is best to raise your hand and ask for help.  
</p>

<H2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</H2>

<p>Initially look to google and other resources then failing this look to group conversations on Discord. Still having issues I will re-read tutorials or tasks I am assigned and approach with a fresh perspective. Failing all of this I will raise my hand.</p>
<h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
<p>I understand that they are leading the cohort through the material, I do not expect that individuals leading the DevAcademy program to do the exercises for cohort members. However, I hope that I can infer or understand the material from their directions and be able to apply the techniques as assigned.   </p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
<p>I don’t have any other commitments at this time. If I do(Doctor or Dental) I will raise them early on. </p>
