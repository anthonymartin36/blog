<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>
    <image style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; width: 200px; float:right;" src="images/DesignImage.PNG" label="Margins, Borders and Padding" />
    In HTML and CSS there are a number of different properties that can be called that would surrounded a particular stated area of a Web Page, i.e. Tables, Top, Bottom, Navigation, banner and main contents. Margins, Borders and padding are stated options to a particular area where these styles can be added. These typical sMargins are used to create space around elements, outside, at the border or within.</p>
    
<h2>Margins</h2>
<p>Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. These elements can have a number of different styles that can be attached to them to ensure that they are separated from different areas of a Web Page. The most common properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left), or one universal setting for all (margins).
</p> 
<code> 
<ul>
    <li>margin-top</li>
    <li>margin-right</li>
    <li>margin-bottom</li>
    <li>margin-left</li>
</ul> 
</code>
<p>
    These can be set either by pixels, percentages, em's, inherited by a parent Style. There are other property settings that can be set, but we will focus on these ones for the present moment.
</p>    
<h2>Borders</h2>
<p>The border property in CSS is used to style the border of an element. This property is a combination of three other properties border-width, border-style, and border-color which can be used as a shorthand notation for these three properties. It sets or returns the border-width, border-style, border-color Properties. Border styles can be set to a number of different types. These include; solid, none, hidden, dashed, dotted and double. Borders are the in effect barrier of the element.
</p>   
<h2>Padding</h2> 
<p>
    Padding is the area within the border of the element that can be set up to distance the main text/content from the border of the element itself. CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:
</p>    
<code> <ul>
    <li>padding-top</li>
    <li>padding-right</li>
    <li>padding-bottom</li>
    <li>padding-left</li>
</code></ul>
    <p>
    Padding width can be defined for the whole area or as stated above can be set for each side of the element. 
</p>  
<p>
    It is important to note that you can add Margin and Padding to an element, when developing try to avoid duplicate efforts.
</p>
<h2>How I used these Styles</h2>
<p> 
<image style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; width: 200px; float:right;" src="images/MainClass.PNG" label="Sample CSS Code" />
When using the Style's, I worked from the outside in. This is an approach that worked for me. For example I set up margins on the outside of the main area. To define the outside structure of the page and from there I worked inwards. Setting up padding for individual elements. This is so as to display the contents in a controlled manner.
