        Problem Solving
    </h1>
    <p>
        <h2> Blocked on a simple problem </h2>
        <p>I was trying to set the value of an Object Key value, and getting lost on how to assign this. I went online a googled the issue and was directed to a few different places. 
        I probably did not use the correct term or phrase and ended up on some random pages on Stack Overflow. Eventually I went back to the page in the student handbook and read the what was required from beginning to end and then attempted to resolve the issue again. 
        Initially I was frustrated which was to be expected and then when I had a little success then I was more comfortable in working through the problems, and not getting dissuaded. I learned to use search terms correctly, re-read the problem and take a break to get some perspective. </p>  
        
    </p>

        <h2> Eleganty solved a problem </h2>
        <p>Looking at the FizzBuzz issue. Separating out the the numbers in an array and establishing weather the value is divisible by 3, 5 or 15. 
            Once the function was called then I wrote the code to take the array and separate out to an individual value and using an if â€¦ else loop determine if the result of dividing the value passed by the figures above for each loop. 
            Then replace the value in the array with the related term("Buzz", "Fizz", or "FizzBuzz"). I knew the logic to be applied the loops, the array value passed and the value of te individual value and establishing weather it meets the condition applied if not move onto the next loop and so on. 
            The learning for me was the division ensuring no result from the calculation, this took with a search online to find the correct logic to apply.   </p>

        <h2> Using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes </h2>
        <p></p>  
        <p>

            <ol>
            <li>Pseudocode </li>
            <p>This is something I only started into later in the software process to be able to some the problems. </p>
            <li>Trying something and Console.logging </li>
            <p>Often this was my approach to trying and solving issues, testing an approach and console logging out the result to understand hte effectiveness of the logic applied.</p>
            <li>Rubber ducky method </li>
            <p> This appears to be breaking the code down into smaller, more managable peices so as to potentially identify the root cause. </p>
            <li>Reading error messages </li>
            <p> Reading error messages is a great help, to look at why and for specifically hich line and what character is the source of the cause of the error, for here the issue can be examined </p>
            <li>Googling </li>
            <p> Searching for a method or the correct syntax to call on different available code to resovle the issue. This was also a good way to see correct code in action.</p>
            <li>Asking your peers for help </li>
            <p> This also is a method to see code running correctly</p>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <p> Although I have not needed to do this yet. I am sure I will do this before the end of the Foundation Sprints  </p>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
            <p> This really is to look at learning from what has been done so as to apply the learning in future. Good habit to reflect and write down the learning. </p>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>A time you were reluctant to ask for help</h2>
        <p>I haven't had to ask for hel yet. I tell a lie, I did have to ask for help to get to use Npx serve and Localhost up and running. So thanks Team for helping out.</p>
