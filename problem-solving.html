        <h2>A time you were reluctant to ask for help</h2>
        <p>Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings. It’s about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think.</p>
        <p>It is highlighted that food has a significant effect on our mental state. I personally prefer to reduce the amount of sugar, as I am aware of the feelings of ilation and then crash with lack of motivation. 
            It is also to to be aware to eat well and healthy, and rest. Be consious of ones emotions and reflect on interactions from one self and the emotions and reactions of others. My plan is to eat regularly, and in a healthy mannor.  </p>

        <h2>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief in a higher power.</p>
        <p>For me I prefer to exercise and keep fit. This has a great impact on my mental and emotional state. Being able to have regular sleep. I go to the GYM 5 days a week.</p>
