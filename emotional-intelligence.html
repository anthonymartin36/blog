    <h2>
        What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand the emotional state within ones self and that of others around us. To be aware of your individual emotions within, be able to characterize them to and to understand the source of these emotions, so as to manage experiences in the future. It is also ability to understand the emotional of others around us, be present and respectful of their situation and manage those emotions. Daniel Goleman divided Emotional Intelligence into ‘Personal’ and ‘Social’ competences, which broadly split between personal (including self-awareness, self regulation and motivation) and interpersonal skills (involving empathy and social skills).

    </h2>
    <p>

    <h2>
        Why is EQ important?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Emotional intelligence is important at work so you can perceive, reason with, understand and manage the emotions of yourself and others. Being able to handle emotions gives you the ability to guide and help people, and it can help you be happier and more successful.
    </p>    
    <p>A few reasons why emotional intelligence is important in the workplace include helping you to:
        <br />
        Understand nonverbal communication: You have the chance to fix a situation before it becomes a problem. For example, if you notice a coworker displaying some nonverbal signs of sadness, you might take them aside to offer empathy.
        <br />
        Be self-aware of personal emotions: You can use this skill to adjust your behavior before it becomes an issue for a client or coworker. For example, if you know you had a rough night, you might attempt to change your behavior the following workday by shifting your focus toward more positive feelings.
        <br />
        Improve efficiencies: When you are empathetic and understanding of other people's emotions, you can make decisions with ease and complete tasks more efficiently.
        <br />
        Further your career: Emotional intelligence and leadership skills go hand in hand. Actively displaying abilities such as patience, active listening, positivity and empathy can help you advance to a leadership role or earn a title promotion or raise.
        <br />
        Encourage others to develop strong interpersonal skills: Emotions are contagious, and displaying explicit motivation, empathy, responsibility and teamwork could encourage your team to follow along.
