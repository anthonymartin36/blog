Listening and Looping

What was it like to be fully listened to?
Amazing, I really enjoyed it

What was it like to listen fully?
It was hard but i did my best.

Code Readability
Code Readability is about practising the following habits when you are working on code:

Indentation/formatting your code to best practice standards.
Consistency in how you name things and how you format your code.
Naming things well (functions and variables) so you can tell what they do or are.
Break things into small segments (many small functions compared to one big function).
D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Commenting a complicated section, so people have some idea before reading your code.
Not commenting everything or obvious things.
Refactoring.
Clean code.

Its really important that code is ledgable. If you have to retunr to it it is important that it can be read. 


Intorductions to E6, introduced in 2015. Changes is some of how the code works and updates to how fundamentals are uses.
Variable Declarations and setting: Const(allow a value to be of a consistent value) and Let (amend to a value), rather than Var.
array concatination ... add arrays to each other or return strings. 
Pointing functions using fat arrow => to forfill and return condition.
You can easily put variables and expressions - for example '' simplification


Software Testing

Earlier examples included using Console.log - to understand the values within the code to see it is working correctly. The different type of testing is Unit Testing and Test Driven Development. 

Unit testing doesn't care if our project works as expected but instead makes sure each of its functions does what we need them to. As we can rely on the small pieces of code, we can build our larger pieces on top of them, knowing they are working correctly.

Test Driven Development
TDD is an approach were you don not necessarly test all the code within a software project. Rather that you write the code so as to forfill a particular function before implementing. Then writing the code to meet the  individual tasks as part of the over all project. 

Once the code works, we go back and refactor it to make it more concise and readable.
