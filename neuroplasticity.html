        Neuroplasticity
    </h1>
    <p>
        <h2> Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due to experience. It is a term referring to the brain's ability to change, reorganize, or grow neural networks. This can involve functional changes due to brain damage or structural changes due to learning.</p>
            <p> It's understood that the brain's neuroplasticity allows it to reorganize pathways, create new connections, and, in some cases, even create new neurons. </p>
            <p> Neuroplasticity also enables people to recover from stroke, injury and helps create new ways of functioning and behaviour for those experiencing autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, depression, addictions, and reverse obsessive-compulsive patterns.</p>
            <p> There are two main types of neuroplasticity:
                <b>Functional plasticity</b> is the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas.
                <b>Structural plasticity</b> is the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning.</p>
        </p>  
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. </h3>
        <p>Since the late 1990s, neuroscientists have been talking about “cells that fire together, network together.” This means that when you perform a task or remember information, the connections between these cells are strengthened, causing different neurons to fire together. Over time, these connections become thick, robust road maps that connect different parts of the brain—and stimulating one neuron in the sequence is more likely to trigger the next neuron. Therefore, Willis says, “Practice creates permanence. The more often the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.” </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>Here are a few tips for making your classroom friendly to malleable brains:</p>

        <p> Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing the material in various ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.<p>
            
        <p> Put information in context. Recognising that learning is the formation of new or stronger neural connections makes sense to prioritize activities that help students tap into already-existing pathways (for instance, by integrating academic subjects or creating class projects relevant to their lives). In other words, nix the rote memorization. "Whenever new material is presented in such a way that students see relationships" between concepts, writes Willis, "they generate greater brain cell activity and achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval."</p>
            
        <p> Let students know that this is how the brain works. Breaking through those neuro-mythological barriers that paint intelligence as predetermined may ease students' minds and encourage them to use their brains. Willis notes, "Especially for students who believe they are 'not smart,' the realization that they can change their brains through study and review is empowering."</p>
            
        <p> Learning a different language or learning how to play an instrument is also a way of changing the neuro plasticity of a persons brain. As a given exercise, practicing mindfulness and plenty of sleep also assists in this area. </p>    
    </p>
    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
            In her book, "Mindset," psychologist Carol Dweck says that success comes from having the right mindset rather than intelligence, talent or education. People with a fixed mindset believe that they're born with certain intelligence, skills and abilities that cannot change.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>People with a growth mindset see problems not as problems to be solved, but as opportunities to grow. They believe that with hard work and perseverance, they can achieve their goals and reach their full potential.</p>
        
        <h3> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
        <p> There are a number of steps to look at:
        <ol>
        <li>Identify your own mindset</li>.
        <li>Look at your own improvements.</li>
        <li>Review the success of others.</li>
        <li>Seek feedback.</li>
        <li>Harness the power of 'yet'</li>
        <li>Learn something new.</li>
        <li>Make mistakes.</li>
        <li> Be kind to yourself.</li>
        </ol>
        Understand what type of mindset you have, and then look at how one is applying the techniques.

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies </h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
        <p>I think it will be great taken the points discussed above. Really looking forward to applying this in my studies. It has opened my mind.</p>
