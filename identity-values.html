    Identity and Values

    <h2>
    When have you had to make an ethical decision?
    </h2>
    <p>
    While working at the Bank, ensuring the security of customer Bank accounts is the most important part of the job. So taking the customer through the process of identification is paramount. Customers of course will be calling the Bank and be adamant about being assisted regardless of the Bank's processes. Unfortunately, if a customer is unwilling or being too belligerent a customer will be advised to go to a bank branch with a valid photo before we can assist them. A very large amount of the Bank's Operating resources are being directed into digital resources and away from the local Bank branch. So then, situations will occur where retired individuals or individuals who are in mental institutions, prisons and retirement homes. There is also the concern of when individuals call pretending to be the customer, which is more common than thought, as not everyone speaks English as a first language.
    This is when one must have patience, communicate clearly and concisely, yet be respectful of the individual's personal circumstances, for example limits on  language, speech capability and comprehension. Looking into making a final decision on whether this customer is legitimate and giving the individual the benefit of the doubt.

    <h2>
    How your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
        At the bank we had a number of values used to put context in our approach to our work, for example; Integrity, Collaboration, Accountability, Respect and Excellence. Although for the majority of the time working at the Bank we worked individually, and given the rote and repetitive nature of the work it was hard to keep sight of what is the best approach to the work. These values were an important reminder when working, to consider whether one is being respectful or being accountable. So adopting these as behaviors influenced my attitude towards my work.

    <h2>
    Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Past experience has demonstrated that I am focused, hardworking, consistent and professional. 
    I do the best I can to present myself in a professional manner. When looking to resolve a situation I look to provide the appropriate context and nothing more. I can work well on my own or within teams. I fail to avoid hard work, what needs to be done just has to be done. Finally it would be hard for me to take breaks, or irregular sick leave. Unless I am actually sick only then I would take leave.  I do my utmost to demonstrate my success, based on my results. 
    </p>
    <h2>
    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
    There are a couple of points which in hindsight, I could have made different decisions. For example, leaving good bosses early or taking a promotion to a team with a not as productive manager. Other examples include, Managing office politics and having a better relationship with a manager and fellow team mates. I can be quite impersonalable and focused on my own results. I am aware of my shortcomings and want to focus on achieving results and working within a team to achieve an outcome. 
    </p>
    <h2>
    Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why    </h2>
    <p>
    While working on a previous project with several individuals, we had to work together to provide an outcome. From the outset, the team identified the goal of the project and set the team members into roles to be fulfilled. The project work was long and arduous, with many roadblocks and crossroads where decisions had to be made that would mean less features would be provided on the conclusion of the project. Many times individual team members would be unhappy with the level of effort that was being put in by other team members. To correct this I would take these individuals aside, grab a coffee or go for a walk. Then we would look at the crux of the matter and discuss it. Understanding the problem and what potential solutions may be used to resolve this. Keeping in mind the goal of the project. This gave the individual time to be heard and be able to put their issues into perspective. From this we were able to return to the work and move forwards with the project at hand.
