        <h2>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings. It’s about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think.</p>
        <p>It is highlighted that food has a significant effect on our mental state. I personally prefer to reduce the amount of sugar, as I am aware of the feelings of ilation and then crash with lack of motivation. 
            It is also to to be aware to eat well and healthy, and rest. Be consious of ones emotions and reflect on interactions from one self and the emotions and reactions of others. My plan is to eat regularly, and in a healthy mannor.  </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief in a higher power.</p>
        <p>For me I prefer to exercise and keep fit. This has a great impact on my mental and emotional state. Being able to have regular sleep. I go to the GYM 5 days a week.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief in a higher power.</p>
        <p>I am not a religious person. However, I do prefer to be alone, some times I go for a walk to get some fresh air and reflect on previous experiences. Bring them to be a conclusion, and be able to let them go. A sometimes go for a walk in the evening. </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you care about and who you share your life with.</p>
        <p>Wellington is a great town, if not expensive. However, it is a great place to go out with friends and eat and have a good conversations hear stories and events and digress with them. I am fortunate enought to have good friends and colleagues to do this with. I do this some weeks. </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Whenua (land)</h2>
        <p>As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the land and the natural environment is strongly connected to your health and wellbeing.</p>
        <p>We are greatful to live in a Beautiful country, here in New Zealand. I am fortunate that I am part of a Men's Choir. I go once a week to Island bay and sing with them for two hrs per term. This give me time to pause, commune and connect with others.  </p>
