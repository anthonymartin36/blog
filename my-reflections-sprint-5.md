Reflections - Sprint - 5 
Student - Anthony Martin

Tic-Tac-Toe
I really struggled with this Sprint project. It took me a lot longer to complete this project, as I went into the following week. 

The main area of the challenge was the event listeners and getting them to operate against the table individual cells. I did reach out for support a few times. 

I was able to build two arrays in the end that would check individual cells for their value. The event listeners only worked on Friday morning and Managed to finish the project by the following Tuesday. This was quite a frustrating project to complete. I had to search the web watch videos, read a lot of web pages to understand the querySelector/All() and native event listener. My solution is very crude however, it works.

Inflate The Unicorn
This again took a little bit of time to complete the event listening, and querySelector() - however once this was complete applying the logic and using the confetti was straight forward. 

Whack a Mole
This project took a little bit more time to complete, I struggled with the layout selection and action of the image tags, this would routinely take  time, building the logic of the actions was quite straight forward. I managed to complete the project by the end of the sprint.
