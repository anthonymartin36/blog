    When have you had to make an ethical decision?
    </h2>
    <p>
    While working at the Bank, ensuring the security of customer Bank accounts is the most important part of the job. So taking the customer through the process of identification is paramount. Customers of course will be calling the Bank and be adamant about being assisted regardless of the Bank's processes. Unfortunately, if a customer is unwilling or being too belligerent a customer will be advised to go to a bank branch with a valid photo before we can assist them. A very large amount of the Bank's Operating resources are being directed into digital resources and away from the local Bank branch. So then, situations will occur where retired individuals or individuals who are in mental institutions, prisons and retirement homes. There is also the concern of when individuals call pretending to be the customer, which is more common than thought, as not everyone speaks English as a first language.
    This is when one must have patience, communicate clearly and concisely, yet be respectful of the individual's personal circumstances, for example limits on  language, speech capability and comprehension. Looking into making a final decision on whether this customer is legitimate and giving the individual the benefit of the doubt.
